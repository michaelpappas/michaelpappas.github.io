      <p style="align-content: center;">I'm a curious and inquisitive person by nature and I've found this to be a common thread both personally and professionally. I enjoy experiencing the world around me by making it.
      This lead me to get a degree in product design. Through various jobs I've been tasked with starting from zero and having to come up to speed on new technology and techniques, whether that's in food production and development, fiber optic network infrastructure, or HVAC building automation controls. In my most recent role I came to realize that I had developed a great amount of knowledge in problem solving in an organized and methodical way. Being presented with a building full of broken or malfunctioning equipment makes you hone your skills in prioritizing and triaging the most pressing issues to deal with. I loved this aspect of the job and the endless roads to go down in terms of technical specialization but realized that spending time programming on my computer in a camping chair on a construction site wasn't for me. I learned a lot of invaluable skills on this job like translating technical issues and timelines for clients to keep them abreast of deadlines for mission critical infrastructure. Iâ€™m looking to continue this journey with a new set of skills in web development and software engineering.
